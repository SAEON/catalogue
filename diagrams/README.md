# Documentation Diagrams
A number of diagrams are provided with the aim of full coverage over the architecture, deployment, and use-cases of this source code. Diagrams are in reference to the [4 + 1 architectural view model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model).

Digrams are generated using the [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) diagraming tools.

# Mermaid
Diagrams are generated using the [CLI](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid.cli) via Docker.

```sh
docker pull minlag/mermaid-cli:latest
```

## TODO

- Generate physical-view mmd from the docker-compose file
