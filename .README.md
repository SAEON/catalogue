# @SAEON/ATLAS

This is a tool for exploring SAEON's metadata catalogues interactively, and with specific emphasis of searching for datasets that contain OGC-compliant resources. This tool is currently deployed at [atlas.saeon.ac.za](https://atlas.saeon.ac.za), but the intention is that bespoke deployments are supported that allow for configuring any number of catalogues to be searched.

The repository is organized as a 'monorepo', split according to the following packages:

- [@saeon/atlas-client](https://github.com/SAEONData/saeon-atlas/tree/master/src/%40saeon/atlas-client)
- [@saeon/atlas-api](https://github.com/SAEONData/saeon-atlas/tree/master/src/%40saeon/atlas-api)
- [@saeon/anyproxy](https://github.com/SAEONData/saeon-atlas/tree/master/src/%40saeon/anyproxy)
- [@saeon/catalogue-search](https://github.com/SAEONData/saeon-atlas/tree/master/src/%40saeon/catalogue-search)
- [@saeon/ol-react](https://github.com/SAEONData/saeon-atlas/tree/master/src/%40saeon/ol-react)
- [docs](https://github.com/SAEONData/saeon-atlas/tree/master/src/docs)

# Quick start

Packages are mostly self-contained, in that each package includes a `package.json` file, and tracks it's own dependencies. For development purposes it's useful that packages can reference source code in other packages (instead of build output), and for this reason Babel is configured globally.

### Setup the repository for developing

NOTE: This repository only support Linux/Mac development currently, since it's farily straightforward to configure a Linux development environment using WSL on Windows (or similar). If there is interest in further cross platform support please [request this](https://github.com/SAEONData/saeon-atlas/issues).

```sh
# Download the source code
git clone git@github.com:SAEONData/saeon-atlas.git saeon-atlas
cd saeon-atlas

# Install top level dependencies (Babel, tooling, etc)
npm install

# Install package dependencies (this might take several minutes on the first run)
npm run install-package-dependencies

# Update repository git configuration
npm run configure-git

# Sometimes the scripts in scripts/ don't get the correct permissions set on clone. Fix this
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### Start the services

Running the atlas requires starting 3 services:

- src/@saeon/atlas-client
- src/@saeon/atlas-api
- src/@saeon/anyproxy

It's useful to start these services individually for helpful log output (a terminal that allows for split screen is great for this). To start all three services together, run `npm start` from the root of the repository.

# Deployment

#### Configuration

TODO

#### Docker Compose

```sh
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate --build
```

#### Automated deployment

Forking this repository should allow for using the GitHub deployment configuration specified in `.github/workflows/deploy-master.yml`. Using the existing deployment specification should be as simple as:

1. Configure a self hosted GitHub actions runner on your server
2. Adjust the `.github/workflows/deploy-master.yml` to include configuration variables sensible for your environment
3. The deployment should run on every push to the master branch

#### Publishing NPM packages

TODO
